RedFS (www.vikrama.co.in/blog/) is a single-file-system (SFS), i.e the underlying storage of a REDFS is a windows file. RedFS exports volumes (or drives) in windows explorer that the user can treat as normal windows drives, i.e C:\, D:\ etc. These volumes can be cloned, you may take snapshots etc. Apart from that, individual files/folders may also be cloned either within the same volume or across volumes. Deduplication and compression are supported for data across all volumes. i.e Cross volume dedupe. You can also use RedFS to create RAW disks that windows can format as NTFS/FAT32. Redfs allows you to clone/snapshot these NTFS/FAT32 drives and also perform Deduplication ops on them. RedFS will also soon support incremental delta backups (like rsync) of you local windows folders and files.
