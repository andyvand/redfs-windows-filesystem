#Working features as on 4/5/2013

= Introduction =

List of features that are either working fully or partially.

= Performance =

For a SSD with 160MBps aggr on a NTFS volume, REDFS can do about 80 Mbps. Remember that redfs sits on another filesystem. Reads are similar. However when reading sparse files, speeds can go upto 400 Mbps.

= Details =

 * Support for clones of volumes.
 * File cloning of any file within the same volume.
 * Cloning of a file across any volume.
 * Directory cloning, both within the same volume and cross-volume.
 * Deduplication (not really optimized)
 * FAT32/NTFS drives that can be mounted as virtual drives on windows. Use redfs initiator. Something like the iSCSI initiator to mount block storage devices.
 * Correct display of all stats such as physical data usage, logical data, dedupe savings, virtual drive sizes etc.
